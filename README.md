## Why it's called PleaseBaoMe?

Viewing SQLite file in iOS developing brings a variety of inconvenience. Therefore, a visible and effective tool to view SQLite file is terribly￼demanded.

Thanks [CocoaHTTPServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer) for making this idea come true. Thanks Tonny for fixing grammar mistakes in README.md. Thanks my friend [Mr.Bao](https://github.com/baoyongzhang), who has enlightened me to use DynamicServer to handle request.

So this project is named after him for showing gratitude.

In Chinese, 'Bao' means 'Hug', and represents purity and happiness.
